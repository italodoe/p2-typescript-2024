          <p>Breathing in the dark, lying on its side</p>
          <p>
            The ruins of the day painted with a scar And the more I straighten
            out, the less it wants to try
          </p>
          <p>
            The feelings start to rot, one wink at a time Oh-oh, forgiving who
            you are, for what you stand to gain Just know that if you hide, it
            doesn't go away When you get out of bed, don't end up stranded
            Horrified with each stone on the stage, my little dark age
          </p>

          <p>Picking through the cards, knowing what's nearby</p>
          <p>The carvings on the face say they find it hard</p>
          <p>And the engine's failed again, all limits of disguise</p>
          <p>The humor's not the same, coming from denial</p>
          <p>
            Oh-oh, I grieve in stereo, the stereo sounds strange I know that if
            you hide, it doesn't go away If you get out of bed and find me
            standing all alone Open-eyed, burn the page, my little dark age
          </p>
          <p>
            I grieve in stereo, the stereo sounds strange You know that if it
            hides, it doesn't go away If I get out of bed, you'll see me
            standing all alone Horrified on the stage, my little dark age
          </p>
          <p>Giddy with delight, seeing what's to come</p>
          <p>The image of the dead, dead ends in my mind</p>
          <p>
            Policemen swear to God, love seeping from their guns I know my
            friends and I would probably turn and run If you get out of bed,
            come find us heading for the bridge Bring a stone, all the rage, my
            little dark age
          </p>
          <p>
            I grieve in stereo, the stereo sounds strange I know that if you

              As dawn broke over the horizon, the world was bathed in a soft,
              golden light. The landscape was bathed in hues of pink and orange,
              as if the sky itself was ablaze with the promise of a new day. Dew
              glistened like diamonds upon the grass, each blade shimmering with
              the first light of morning. It was a moment of quiet anticipation,
              a fleeting glimpse of the beauty that awaited in the hours to
              come.
